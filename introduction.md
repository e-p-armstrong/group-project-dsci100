Heart disease is an often-lethal condition, and being able to accurately predict if patients have it, based on easy-to-observe qualities, would allow for quicker action from doctors and better patient outcomes. So here we ask the question: is it possible to predict whether a patient has heart disease based on a set of measurable factors? To build a model that could answer this, we used the publicly-available heart disease dataset donated by the Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, the University Hospitals of Zurich and Basel, the V. A. Medical Center of Long Beach, and the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. Each row in this dataset represents a patient, and the columns store physical, health-related information about each patient — such as their age, sex, type of chest pain, and resting blood pressure. There are 14 variables in total. The column we are attempting to predict has values of either “true” or “false”, indicating whether a patient has some variety of heart disease. The dataset contains four databases, each with around 100 to 300 patients, donated by institutions in Switzerland, Hungary, and two locations in America. We trained and tested our model on data from all of the databases, as this gives us a larger sample size, and an additional variable to work with (region). This brings the total number of columns in our dataset to 15.
